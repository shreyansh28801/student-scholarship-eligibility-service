# student-scholarship-eligibility
 Design a microservice-based API to determine student scholarship eligibility from CSV files with up to 50,000 records. Users can upload files via a Swagger endpoint, and the API processes them to update eligibility status dynamically. It supports roll number searches and uses multi-threading and in-memory databases or caches for efficiency.
